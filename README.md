Just messing around with AngularJS to try and make a functional web calculator. 

Demo: http://jaredkrau.se/calculator

Installation: 

1) In the project root, run 'npm install'

2) In the project root, run 'bower install'

3) Run gulp to compile all static assets from 'src' into their build destinations.

4) Optional: Run gulp watch to poll for changes.


There are tons of known issues in this project, as this is one of my first experiments with AngularJS, it is more just to mess around and figure out some angular tricks. 

The bugs may get fixed in the future... or maybe not.
