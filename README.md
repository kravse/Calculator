Just messing around with AngularJS to try and make a functional web calculator. 

1) In the project root, run 'npm install'

2) In the project root, run 'bower install'

3) Run gulp to compile all static assets from 'src' into their build destinations.

4) Optional: Run gulp watch to poll for changes.
